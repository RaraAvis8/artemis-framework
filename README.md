Artemis is a high performance Entity System framework for games, written in Java, and is a framework to manage entities in a game world. It is inspired by Entity Systems are the future of MMORPG blog series by Adam Martin. We also borrowed ideas from Ted Brown who implemented a simple high-performance Entity System in Processing based on Adam Martin's blog.

The framework is based on the concept that entities in a game world exist as pure identifiers, their components contain only data, and systems process entities based on their aspects. This promotes separation of concern and simplifies game design tremendously.
