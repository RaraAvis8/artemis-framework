# Introduction #

Artemis is a high performance Entity System framework for games, written in Java, and is a framework to manage entities in a game world. It is inspired by Entity Systems are the future of MMORPG articles by Adam Martin on t-machine.org. We also borrowed ideas from Ted Brown who implemented a simple high-performance Entity System in Processing.
