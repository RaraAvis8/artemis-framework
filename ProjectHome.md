Artemis is a high performance Entity System framework for games, written in Java, and is a framework to manage entities in a game world. It is inspired by Entity Systems are the future of MMORPG articles by Adam Martin on t-machine.org. We also borrowed ideas from Ted Brown who implemented a simple high-performance Entity System in Processing.

Artemis library is only 26 KB in size, it has no dependencies and can be used with any game framework or library, 2D or 3D.
